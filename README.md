# Virtual Assistant

Welcome to the **Virtual Assistant** project! This small experiment was created a year ago as an exploration into building a text-to-speech assistant using the OpenAI API. While it’s not a full-fledged assistant, it served as a fun and educational foray into the world of AI integration.

## Project Overview
This virtual assistant prototype demonstrates:
- **Text-to-Speech Integration**: Converts text responses from the OpenAI API into spoken audio.

### Note
This was a quick experiment and not a polished or serious project. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a starting point for your own AI-powered applications.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the OpenAI API key in the configuration file.
3. Run the script to test the text-to-speech functionality.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I:
- Gained experience working with the OpenAI API.
- Experimented with text-to-speech libraries.
- Discovered areas to improve for future AI-based projects.

## Future Improvements
While this project was not pursued further, potential enhancements could include:
- Adding voice recognition for a full conversational experience.
- Expanding functionalities to include task management or web search.

Thank you for checking out this early experiment. Feel free to explore the code and build upon it if you’re interested!
